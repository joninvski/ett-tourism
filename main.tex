\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
The value of tourism as an economic and leisure activity.

The amount and quality of data that municipalities have in their information systems. 
Data is held not only by cities but by other entities as well.
Municipalities understand the value of this data and have gone through a multi-step process for sharing this data with tourists in order to improve their experience and attract them to the city.

First municipalities create apps for sharing data with the tourists.
Small market to recuperate investment.
Municipalities are not software houses: unable to keep up with the pace of innovation. 
They are limited in the types of applications they can provide: e.g. publishing negative opinions.

Then municipalities made data available to programmers through internal open data initiatives.
Each city uses its own format.
Programmers still have to deal with a small market.
Tourists still have difficulties finding the specific apps for each city.

\subsection{Challenges}
Common API when intersection among available data is small.
Flexibility to accommodate further usages not yet envisioned.

make way for delegation and common developer keys?


\subsection{CitySDK}
Talk about the project.

Briefly introduce the API.

This document is organised ...

This is an acronym expansion: \ac{citysdk}.
This is a test citation, to be removed later~\cite{1509968}.

\subsection{\acf{W3C} POI Working Group}
The \ac{W3C} is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. This community is led by Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe. 

One of the its working groups is the \ac{W3C} POI~\cite{w3c-poi} and its mission is to develop technical specifications for the representation of \acf{POI} information on the Web. Its Core defines a generic, flexible, lightweight and extensible POI data model, and one normative syntax for the data model based on \acf{XML}. Although \ac{XML} is the primary model for this specification, other formats are also possible, such as \acf{JSON}.

The data model is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:data-model}. A brief explanation is given next.

\label{fig:data-model}
\end{figure*}

The data model is comprised of six entities:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{POIBaseType} is the common entity from which the majority of POI entities are derived. It provides basic properties related with its authorship, licensing, modification dates and identification allowing each element to carry distinct information;
\item \textbf{POITermType} is an abstract entity derived from POIBaseType and adds properties for the management of categorical descriptions, such as the ones seen in category, link, label, author, license and time properties of POIType;
\item \textbf{POIType} is an abstract entity derived from POIBaseType and adds entities for describing, labeling, categorizing and indicating the time span of a POI or group of POIs. The entity also incudes linking elements to other POIs, external web resources or metadata;
\item \textbf{Location} is of type POIBaseType and provides a flexible description of the location of a POI. A Location can be represented using geodetic coordinates for the center of the POI, line, polygon, civic address,  undetermined or bounding box (relationship element);
\item \textbf{POI} is of type POIType and adds the Location entity for describing the location of the POI;
\item Finally, \textbf{POIS} is of type POIType and can have one or more children entities of type POI.
\end{itemize}
